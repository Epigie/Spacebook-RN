# SpaceBook
## _In Space... no one can hear you scream.... but they can read it!_

Spacebook is a **REACT-NATIVE** JS application built for my Mobile Applications Unit during University. The app utilises a backend API written by [Ashley Williams](https://github.com/ash-williams/Spacebook) in order to emulate the feeling of using a Social Media platform.


## Features

- Create posts
- Schedule posts
- Create drafts
- Search for friends
- Add and manage friends
- Upload a custom Profile Picture
- *Plus Many more*

## Dependencies

All Dependencies are available to install from the package.json file, simply run:
```bash
foo@bar:~ npm install
```
whilst inside the Spacebook subdirectory.

## Usage

Ensure the API is running on localhost:3333, then launch the project via Expo:
```bash
foo@bar:~ npm start
```
